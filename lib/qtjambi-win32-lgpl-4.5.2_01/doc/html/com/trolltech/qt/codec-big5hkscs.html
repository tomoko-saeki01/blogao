 </tr></table><body><p><hr><p><center><h1>Big5-HKSCS Text Codec</h1></center><p> The Big5-HKSCS codec provides conversion to and from the Big5-HKSCS encoding. <p>The codec grew out of the QBig5Codec originally contributed by Ming-Che Chuang &lt;mingche@cobra.ee.ntu.edu.tw&gt;. James Su &lt;suzhe@turbolinux.com.cn&gt; &lt;suzhe@gnuchina.org&gt; and Anthony Fok &lt;anthony@thizlinux.com&gt; &lt;foka@debian.org&gt; implemented HKSCS-1999 QBig5hkscsCodec for Qt-2.3.x, but it was too late in Qt development schedule to be officially included in the Qt-2.3.x series. <p>Wu Yi &lt;wuyi@hancom.com&gt; ported the HKSCS-1999 QBig5hkscsCodec to Qt-3.0.1 in March 2002. <p>With the advent of the new HKSCS-2001 standard, James Su &lt;suzhe@turbolinux.com.cn&gt; &lt;suzhe@gnuchina.org&gt; generated the Big5-HKSCS&lt;-&gt;Unicode tables with a very space-efficient algorithm. He generously donated his code to glibc in May 2002. Subsequently, James has generously allowed Anthony Fok to adapt the code for Qt-3.0.5. <p>Currently, the Big5-HKSCS tables are generated from the following sources, and with the Euro character added: <ol><li> http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/950.txt</li><li> http://www.info.gov.hk/digital21/chi/hkscs/download/big5-iso.txt</li><li> http://www.info.gov.hk/digital21/chi/hkscs/download/big5cmp.txt</li></ol> There may be more fine-tuning to the QBig5hkscsCodec to maximize its compatibility with the standard Big5 (2002) mapping as determined by Li18nux Big5 Standard Subgroup.
