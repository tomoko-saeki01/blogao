Microsoft Windows uses it under the name codepage 936. <p>GBK has been superseded by the new Chinese national standard GB 18030-2000, which added a 4-byte encoding while remaining compatible with GB2312 and GBK. The new GB 18030-2000 may be described as a special encoding of Unicode 3.x and ISO-10646-1. <p>Special thanks to charset gurus Markus Scherer (IBM), Dirk Meyer (Adobe Systems) and Ken Lunde (Adobe Systems) for publishing an excellent GB 18030-2000 summary and specification on the Internet. Some must-read documents are: <ul><li> ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/examples/nutshell/cjkv/pdf/GB18030_Summary.pdf</li><li> http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/charset/source/gb18030/gb18030.html</li><li> http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/charset/data/xml/gb-18030-2000.xml</li></ul> The GBK codec was contributed to Qt by Justin Yu &lt;justiny@turbolinux.com.cn&gt; and Sean Chen &lt;seanc@turbolinux.com.cn&gt;. They may also be reached at Yu Mingjian &lt;yumj@sun.ihep.ac.cn&gt;, &lt;yumingjian@china.com&gt; Chen Xiangyang &lt;chenxy@sun.ihep.ac.cn&gt; <p>The GB18030 codec Qt functions were contributed to Qt by James Su &lt;suzhe@gnuchina.org&gt;, &lt;suzhe@turbolinux.com.cn&gt; who pioneered much of GB18030 development on GNU/Linux systems. <p>The GB18030 codec was contributed to Qt by Anthony Fok &lt;anthony@thizlinux.com&gt;, &lt;foka@debian.org&gt; using a Perl script to generate C++ tables from gb-18030-2000.xml while merging contributions from James Su, Justin Yu and Sean Chen.
