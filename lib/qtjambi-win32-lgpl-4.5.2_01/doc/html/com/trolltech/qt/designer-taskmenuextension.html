In this example we use a custom widget designed to show the task menu extension feature: The TicTacToe widget. <p>An extension is an object which modifies the behavior of Qt Designer. The QDesignerTaskMenuExtension can provide custom task menu entries when a widget with this extension is selected. <p>There are four available types of extensions in Qt Designer: <ul><li> QDesignerContainerExtension provides an extension that allows you to add (and delete) pages to a multi-page container plugin in Qt Designer.</li><li> QDesignerMemberSheetExtension provides an extension that allows you to manipulate a widget's member functions which is displayed when configuring connections using Qt Designer's mode for editing signals and slots.</li><li> QDesignerPropertySheetExtension provides an extension that allows you to manipulate a widget's properties which is displayed in Qt Designer's property editor.</li><li> QDesignerTaskMenuExtension provides an extension that allows you to add custom menu entries to Qt Designer's task menu.</li></ul> You can use all the extensions following the same pattern as in this example, only replacing the respective extension base class. For more information, see the <a href="qtdesigner.html">QtDesigner Module</a>. <p>The Task Menu Extension example consists of five classes: <ul><li> <tt>TicTacToe</tt> is a custom widget that lets the user play the Tic-Tac-Toe game.</li><li> <tt>TicTacToePlugin</tt> exposes the <tt>TicTacToe</tt> class to Qt Designer.</li><li> <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory</tt> creates a <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenu</tt> object.</li><li> <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenu</tt> provides the task menu extension, i.e the plugin's associated task menu entries.</li><li> <tt>TicTacToeDialog</tt> lets the user modify the state of a Tic-Tac-Toe plugin loaded into Qt Designer.</li></ul> The project file for custom widget plugins needs some additional information to ensure that they will work within Qt Designer. For example, custom widget plugins rely on components supplied with Qt Designer, and this must be specified in the project file that we use. We will first take a look at the plugin's project file. <p>Then we will continue by reviewing the <tt>TicTacToePlugin</tt> class, and take a look at the <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory</tt> and <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenu</tt> classes. Finally, we will review the <tt>TicTacToeDialog</tt> class before we take a quick look at the <tt>TicTacToe</tt> widget's class definition.<a name="the-project-file-taskmenuextension-pro"><h2>The Project File: taskmenuextension.pro</h2> The project file must contain some additional information to ensure that the plugin will work as expected:Error parsing snippet.Error parsing snippet.</pre> The <tt>TEMPLATE</tt> variable's value makes <tt>qmake</tt> create the custom widget as a library. Later, we will ensure that the widget will be recognized as a plugin by Qt by using the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro to export the relevant widget information. <p>The <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable contains two values, <tt>designer</tt> and <tt>plugin</tt>: <ul><li> <tt>designer</tt>: Since custom widgets plugins rely on components supplied with Qt Designer, this value ensures that our plugin links against Qt Designer's library (<tt>libQtDesigner.so</tt>).</li><li> <tt>plugin</tt>: We also need to ensure that <tt>qmake</tt> considers the custom widget a plugin library.</li></ul> When Qt is configured to build in both debug and release modes, Qt Designer will be built in release mode. When this occurs, it is necessary to ensure that plugins are also built in release mode. For that reason we add the <tt>debug_and_release</tt> value to the <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable. Otherwise, if a plugin is built in a mode that is incompatible with Qt Designer, it won't be loaded and installed. <p>The header and source files for the widget are declared in the usual way:Error parsing snippet.</pre> We provide an implementation of the plugin interface so that Qt Designer can use the custom widget. In this particular example we also provide implementations of the task menu extension and the extension factory as well as a dialog implementation. <p>It is important to ensure that the plugin is installed in a location that is searched by Qt Designer. We do this by specifying a target path for the project and adding it to the list of items to install: <pre class="snippet">
target.path = $$[QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS]/designer
INSTALLS += target
</pre> The task menu extension is created as a library, and will be installed alongside the other Qt Designer plugins when the project is installed (using <tt>make install</tt> or an equivalent installation procedure). <p>Note that if you want the plugins to appear in a Visual Studio integration, the plugins must be built in release mode and their libraries must be copied into the plugin directory in the install path of the integration (for an example, see <tt>C:/program files/trolltech as/visual studio integration/plugins</tt>). <p>For more information about plugins, see the <a href="plugins-howto.html">How to Create Qt Plugins</a> documentation.<a name="tictactoeplugin-class-definition"><h2>TicTacToePlugin Class Definition</h2> The <tt>TicTacToePlugin</tt> class exposes <tt>the</tt> TicTacToe class to Qt Designer. Its definition is equivalent to the <a href="designer-customwidgetplugin.html">Custom Widget Plugin</a> example's plugin class which is explained in detail. The only part of the class definition that is specific to this particular custom widget is the class name: <pre class="snippet">
#ifndef TICTACTOEPLUGIN_H
#define TICTACTOEPLUGIN_H

#include &lt;QDesignerCustomWidgetInterface&gt;

</pre> The plugin class provides Qt Designer with basic information about our plugin, such as its class name and its include file. Furthermore it knows how to create instances of the <tt>TicTacToe</tt> widget. TicTacToePlugin also defines the initialize() function which is called after the plugin is loaded into Qt Designer. The function's QDesignerFormEditorInterface parameter provides the plugin with a gateway to all of Qt Designer's API's. <p>The <tt>TicTacToePlugin</tt> class inherits from both <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html">QObject</a> and QDesignerCustomWidgetInterface. It is important to remember, when using multiple inheritance, to ensure that all the interfaces (i.e. the classes that doesn't inherit Q_OBJECT) are made known to the meta object system using the Q_INTERFACES() macro. This enables Qt Designer to use qobject_cast() to query for supported interfaces using nothing but a <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html">QObject</a> pointer.<a name="tictactoeplugin-class-implementation"><h2>TicTacToePlugin Class Implementation</h2> The TicTacToePlugin class implementation is in most parts equivalent to the <a href="designer-customwidgetplugin.html">Custom Widget Plugin</a> example's plugin class:<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
TicTacToePlugin::TicTacToePlugin(QObject *parent)
    : QObject(parent)
{
    initialized = false;
}

QString TicTacToePlugin::name() const
{
    return "TicTacToe";

    return ticTacToe;
}

bool TicTacToePlugin::isInitialized() const
{
    return initialized;
}

</pre> The only function that differs significantly is the initialize() function:<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
void TicTacToePlugin::initialize(QDesignerFormEditorInterface *formEditor)
{
</pre> The <tt>initialize()</tt> function takes a QDesignerFormEditorInterface object as argument. The QDesignerFormEditorInterface class provides access to Qt Designer's components. <p>In Qt Designer you can create two kinds of plugins: custom widget plugins and tool plugins. QDesignerFormEditorInterface provides access to all the Qt Designer components that you normally need to create a tool plugin: the extension manager, the object inspector, the property editor and the widget box. Custom widget plugins have access to the same components.<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
    if (initialized)
        return;

    QExtensionManager *manager = formEditor-&gt;extensionManager();
    Q_ASSERT(manager != 0);
</pre> When creating extensions associated with custom widget plugins, we need to access Qt Designer's current extension manager which we retrieve from the QDesignerFormEditorInterface parameter. <p>Qt Designer's QDesignerFormEditorInterface holds information about all Qt Designer's components: The action editor, the object inspector, the property editor, the widget box, and the extension and form window managers. <p>The QExtensionManager class provides extension management facilities for Qt Designer. Using Qt Designer's current extension manager you can retrieve the extension for a given object. You can also register and unregister an extension for a given object. Remember that an extension is an object which modifies the behavior of Qt Designer. <p>When registrering an extension, it is actually the associated extension factory that is registered. In Qt Designer, extension factories are used to look up and create named extensions as they are required. So, in this example, the task menu extension itself is not created until a task menu is requested by the user.<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
    manager-&gt;registerExtensions(new TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory(manager),
                                Q_TYPEID(QDesignerTaskMenuExtension));

    initialized = true;
}

QString TicTacToePlugin::domXml() const
{
    return QLatin1String("\
&lt;ui language=\"c++\"&gt;\
    &lt;widget class=\"TicTacToe\" name=\"ticTacToe\"/&gt;\
&lt;/ui&gt;");
}

</pre> We create a <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory</tt> object that we register using Qt Designer's current extension manager retrieved from the QDesignerFormEditorInterface parameter. The first argument is the newly created factory and the second argument is an extension identifier which is a string. The <tt>Q_TYPEID()</tt> macro simply converts the string into a QLatin1String. <p>The <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory</tt> class is a subclass of QExtensionFactory. When the user request a task menu by clicking the right mouse button over a widget with the specified task menu extension, Qt Designer's extension manager will run through all its registered factories invoking the first one that is able to create a task menu extension for the selected widget. This factory will in turn create a <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenu</tt> object (the extension). <p>We omit to reimplement the QDesignerCustomWidgetInterface::domXml() function (which include default settings for the widget in the standard XML format used by Qt Designer), since no default values are necessary.<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2(taskmenuextension, TicTacToePlugin)
</pre> Finally, we use the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro to export the TicTacToePlugin class for use with Qt's plugin handling classes: This macro ensures that Qt Designer can access and construct the custom widget. Without this macro, there is no way for Qt Designer to use the widget.<a name="tictactoetaskmenufactory-class-definition"><h2>TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory Class Definition</h2> The <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory</tt> class inherits QExtensionFactory which provides a standard extension factory for Qt Designer. <pre class="snippet">
class TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory : public QExtensionFactory
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory(QExtensionManager *parent = 0);

protected:
    QObject *createExtension(QObject *object, const QString &iid, QObject *parent) const;
};
</pre> The subclass's purpose is to reimplement the QExtensionFactory::createExtension() function, making it able to create a <tt>TicTacToe</tt> task menu extension.<a name="tictactoetaskmenufactory-class-implementation"><h2>TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory Class Implementation</h2> The class constructor simply calls the QExtensionFactory base class constructor:<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory::TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory(QExtensionManager *parent)
    : QExtensionFactory(parent)
{
}
</pre> As described above, the factory is invoked when the user request a task menu by clicking the right mouse button over a widget with the specified task menu extension in Qt Designer. <p>Qt Designer's behavior is the same whether the requested extension is associated with a container, a member sheet, a property sheet or a task menu: Its extension manager runs through all its registered extension factories calling <tt>createExtension()</tt> for each until one responds by creating the requested extension.<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
QObject *TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory::createExtension(QObject *object,
                                                   const QString &iid,
                                                   QObject *parent) const
{
    if (iid != Q_TYPEID(QDesignerTaskMenuExtension))
        return 0;

    if (TicTacToe *tic = qobject_cast&lt;TicTacToe*&gt;(object))
        return new TicTacToeTaskMenu(tic, parent);

    return 0;
}
</pre> So the first thing we do in <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenuFactory::createExtension()</tt> is to check if the requested extension is a task menu extension. If it is, and the widget requesting it is a <tt>TicTacToe</tt> widget, we create and return a <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenu</tt> object. Otherwise, we simply return a null pointer, allowing Qt Designer's extension manager to continue its search through the registered factories.<a name="tictactoetaskmenu-class-definition"><h2>TicTacToeTaskMenu Class Definition</h2> <br><center><img src="images/taskmenuextension-menu.png"></center><br> The <tt>TicTacToeTaskMenu</tt> class inherits QDesignerTaskMenuExtension which allows you to add custom entries (in the form of QActions) to the task menu in Qt Designer. <pre class="snippet">

</pre> We reimplement the <tt>preferredEditAction()</tt> and <tt>taskActions()</tt> functions. Note that we implement a constructor that takes two arguments: the parent widget, and the <tt>TicTacToe</tt> widget for which the task menu is requested. <p>In addition we declare the private <tt>editState()</tt> slot, our custom <tt>editStateAction</tt> and a private pointer to the <tt>TicTacToe</tt> widget which state we want to modify.<a name="tictactoetaskmenu-class-implementation"><h2>TicTacToeTaskMenu Class Implementation</h2><br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">

In addition to the dialog's buttons and layouts we declare two <tt>TicTacToe</tt> pointers, one to the widget the user can interact with and the other to the original custom widget plugin which state the user wants to edit.<a name="tictactoedialog-class-implementation"><h2>TicTacToeDialog Class Implementation</h2><br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">

In order to make the change of state visible to Qt Designer we need to set the latter widget's state property using the QDesignerFormWindowInterface class. <p>QDesignerFormWindowInterface provides you with information about the associated form window as well as allowing you to alter its properties. The interface is not intended to be instantiated directly, but to provide access to Qt Designer's current form windows controlled by Qt Designer's form window manager. <p>If you are looking for the form window containing a specific widget, you can use the static QDesignerFormWindowInterface::findFormWindow() function:<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">

</pre> In the end we call the <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QEvent.html#accept()">QEvent::accept()</a> function which sets the accept flag of the event object.
