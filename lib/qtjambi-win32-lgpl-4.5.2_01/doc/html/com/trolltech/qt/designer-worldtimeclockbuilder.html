The resource file contains an entry for the particular form that we wish to use:<pre class="snippet">&lt;!DOCTYPE RCC&gt;&lt;RCC version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;qresource prefix="/forms"&gt;
   &lt;file&gt;form.ui&lt;/file&gt;
&lt;/qresource&gt;
&lt;/RCC&gt;
</pre> Forms do not need to be included with the application in this way. We only include a form in the application's resources for convenience, and to keep the example short.<a name="loading-and-building-the-form"><h2>Loading and Building the Form</h2> Since this example only loads and displays a pre-prepared form, all of the work can be done in the main() function. We are using a class from the <a href="qtuitools.html">QtUiTools</a> library so, in addition to any other Qt classes that are normally required to write an application, we must include the appropriate header file:<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
#include &lt;QtUiTools&gt;
</pre> The main function initializes the resource system with the Q_INIT_RESOURCE() macro and constructs an <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/gui/QApplication.html">QApplication</a> instance in the usual way:<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    Q_INIT_RESOURCE(worldtimeclockbuilder);

    QApplication app(argc, argv);

    QUiLoader loader;
</pre> We construct a QUiLoader object to handle the form we want to use. <p>The form itself is obtained from the resource file system using the path defined in the resource file. We use the form loader to load and construct the form:<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
    QFile file(":/forms/form.ui");
    file.open(QFile::ReadOnly);

    QWidget *widget = loader.load(&file);

    file.close();
    widget-&gt;show();
</pre> Once the form has been loaded, the resource file can be closed and the widget is shown.<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet">
    return app.exec();
}
</pre> The form loader ensures that all the signal and slot connections between objects in the form are set up correctly when the form is loaded. As a result, the time is updated by the World Time Clock widget, and the time zone spin box can be used to change the position of the hour hand.<p /><address><hr /><div align="center">
