After this example, you can also check out the generator example, which uses the generator on a library for creating graphic adventure games.<a name="text-adventure-example"><h2>Text Adventure Example</h2> In keeping with the generator example, we will create an adventure game engine in C++ and map that to Java. However, we will venture a little longer back in time - to the eighties to be exact - when the text adventure had its days of glory. <p>Our text adventure library will contain a command parser, an object tree , and a collection of actions the player can make. The library consists of the following classes: <ul><li> Parser The parser knows how to parse the commands the player enteres, and will execute the commands given.</li><li> AdvObject Represents an object in the game, such as the player, a rooom, or a car. The objects are kept in a tree, which represents the world of the game.</li><li> Action An action represents an action the player can make. It contains a set of sentences (commands) the player can write to execute the action.</li><li> World Contains the root of the object tree, the current location of the player, and the objects held by the player.</li></ul><a name="example-java-game"><h2>Example Java Game</h2> In this section, we take a quick look at a Java game implemented using our text adventure library. <p>We have<p /><address><hr /><div align="center">
