You can later run the <tt>uninstall-qt.py</tt> script to uninstall the binary package. The script is located in /Developer/Tools and must be run as root. <p>The following instructions describe how to install Qt from the source package. <ol><li> If you have the commercial edition of Qt, install your license file as <tt>$HOME/.qt-license</tt>. <p>For the open source version you do not need a license file.</li><li> Unpack the archive if you have not done so already. For example, if you have the <tt>qt-mac-opensource-desktop-%VERSION%.tar.gz</tt> package, type the following commands at a command line prompt: <pre class="snippet">
cd /tmp
gunzip qt-mac-opensource-desktop-%VERSION%.tar.gz        # uncompress the archive
tar xvf qt-mac-opensource-desktop-%VERSION%.tar          # unpack it
</pre> This creates the directory <tt>/tmp/qt-mac-opensource-desktop-%VERSION%</tt> containing the files from the archive.</li><li> Building <p>To configure the Qt library for your machine type, run the <tt>./configure</tt> script in the package directory. <p>By default, Qt is configured for installation in the <tt>/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%</tt> directory, but this can be changed by using the <tt>-prefix</tt> option. <pre class="snippet">
cd /tmp/qt-mac-opensource-desktop-%VERSION%
./configure
</pre> Type <tt>./configure -help</tt> to get a list of all available options. <p>Note that you will need to specify <tt>-universal</tt> if you want to build universal binaries, and also supply a path to the <tt>-sdk</tt> option if your development machine has a PowerPC CPU. By default, Qt is built as a framework, but you can built it as a set of dynamic libraries (dylibs) by specifying the <tt>-no-framework</tt> option. <p>Qt can also be configured to be built with debugging symbols. This process is described in detail in the <a href="debug.html">Debugging Techniques</a> document. <p>To create the library and compile all the demos, examples, tools, and tutorials, type: <pre class="snippet">
make
</pre> If <tt>-prefix</tt> is outside the build directory, you need to install the library, demos, examples, tools, and tutorials in the appropriate place. To do this, type: <pre class="snippet">
sudo make -j1 install
</pre> as root, if neccessary (note that this requires that you have administrator access to your machine). <p>There is a potential race condition when running make install with multiple jobs. It is best to only run one make job (-j1) for the install. <p><b>Note:</b> If you later need to reconfigure and rebuild Qt from the same location, ensure that all traces of the previous configuration are removed by entering the build directory and typing <tt>make confclean</tt> before running <tt>configure</tt> again.</li><li> Environment variables <p>In order to use Qt, some environment variables need to be extended. <pre class="snippet">
PATH               - to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools
</pre> This is done like this: <p>In <tt>.profile</tt> (if your shell is bash), add the following lines: <pre class="snippet">
PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre> In <tt>.login</tt> (in case your shell is csh or tcsh), add the following line: <pre class="snippet">
setenv PATH /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH
</pre> If you use a different shell, please modify your environment variables accordingly.</li><li> That's all. Qt is now installed. <p>If you are new to Qt, we suggest that you take a look at the demos and examples to see Qt in action. Run the Qt Examples and Demos either by typing <tt>qtdemo</tt> on the command line or through the desktop's Start menu. <p>You might also want to try the following links: <ul><li> <a href="how-to-learn-qt.html">How to Learn Qt</a></li><li> <a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a></li><li> <a href="http://qtsoftware.com/developer">Developer Zone</a></li><li> <a href="deployment.html">Deploying Qt Applications</a></li></ul></li></ol> We hope you will enjoy using Qt.
