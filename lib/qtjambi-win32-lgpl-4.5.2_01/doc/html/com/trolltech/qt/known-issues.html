An up-to-date list of known issues with Qt %VERSION% can be found via the <a href="http://qtsoftware.com/developer/task-tracker">Task Tracker</a> on the Qt website which provides additional information about known issues and tasks related to Qt.<a name="issues-with-third-party-software"><h2>Issues with Third Party Software</h2><a name="x11-hardware-support"><h3>X11 Hardware Support</h3> <ul><li> There is a bug in the 169.xx NVIDIA drivers on certain GeForce 8 series cards that is triggered by the OpenGL paint engine when using <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/gui/QPainter.html">QPainter</a> on a <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/opengl/QGLWidget.html">QGLWidget</a> to draw paths and polygons. Some other painting operations that end up in the path fallback are affected as well. The bug causes the whole X server to repeatedly hang for several seconds at a time.</li><li> There is an issue with NVIDIA's 9xxx driver series on X11 that causes a crash in cases where there are several <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/opengl/QGLContext.html">QGLContext</a>s and the extended composition modes are used (the composition modes between and including <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/gui/QPainter.CompositionMode.html">QPainter::CompositionMode_Multiply</a> and <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/gui/QPainter.CompositionMode.html">QPainter::CompositionMode_Exclusion</a>). This affects the composition mode demo in Qt 4.4, for example. The crash does not occur in newer versions of the drivers.</li></ul><a name="windows-hardware-support"><h3>Windows Hardware Support</h3> <ul><li> When using version 6.14.11.6921 of the NVIDIA drivers for the GeForce 6600 GT under Windows XP, Qt applications which use drag and drop will display reduced size drag and drop icons when run alongside applications that use OpenGL. This problem can be worked around by reducing the level of graphics acceleration provided by the driver, or by disabling hardware acceleration completely.</li></ul><a name="windows-software-issues"><h3>Windows Software Issues</h3> <ul><li> In Qt 4.4.0, when there is an accessibility client running, Assistant will crash when the user creates a new tab page and Designer will crash when the user drags and drops certain widgets (<b>Column View</b> or <b>Table Widget</b>, for example). This problem occurs with any application that queries for an accessibility interface; for example, Microsoft Narrator or Notepad++ (versions prior to 4.8.5) trigger these problems.</li><li> Under certain circumstances Visual Studio Integration v1.4.0 will not be able to install the integration for Visual Studio 2005 on Windows Vista. An error message states that .NET Framework v2.0 Service Pack 1 is not installed. This is due to a problem with the built-in installation of this on Windows Vista. This issue can be fixed by installing .NET Framework version 3.5.</li><li> The combination of a Windows bug and certain NVIDIA cards may cause pixmaps used during drag and drop operations to be truncated to 64 x 64 pixels.</li><li> With NVIDIA GeForce 7950 GT (driver version 6.14.11.7824), a fullscreen <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/opengl/QGLWidget.html">QGLWidget</a> flickers when child widgets are shown/hidden. The workaround for this is to use <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/gui/QWidget.html#setGeometry(com.trolltech.qt.core.QRect)">setGeometry()</a> with a width/height 1 pixel bigger than your geometry and call <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/gui/QWidget.html#show()">show()</a>.</li><li> A bug in the Firebird database can cause an application to crash when fbembed.dll is unloaded. The bug is fixed in version 2.5.</li></ul><a name="mac-os-x"><h3>Mac OS X</h3> <ul><li> If a sheet is opened for a given window, clicking the title bar of that window will cause it to flash. This behavior has been reported to Apple (bug number 5827676).</li></ul><p /><address><hr /><div align="center">
