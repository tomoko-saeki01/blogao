Phonon is a cross-platform multimedia framework that enables the use of audio and video content in Qt applications. The <a href="phonon-overview.html">Phonon Overview</a> document provides an introduction to the architecture and features included in Phonon. The Phonon namespace contains a list of all classes, functions and namespaces provided by the module. <p>Applications that use Phonon's classes need to be configured to be built against the Phonon module. The following declaration in a <tt>qmake</tt> project file ensures that an application is compiled and linked appropriately: <pre class="snippet">
