These allow the build process to be fine-tuned, provide useful diagnostic information, and can be used to specify the target platform for your project. <ul><li> <a href="#command-line-options">Command-Line Options</a></li> <ul><li> <a href="#syntax">Syntax</a></li><li> <a href="#options">Options</a></li><li> <a href="#makefile-mode-options">Makefile Mode Options</a></li><li> <a href="#project-mode-options">Project Mode Options</a></li></ul></ul><a name="commands"><a name="command-line-options"><h2>Command-Line Options</h2><a name="syntax"><h3>Syntax</h3> The syntax used to run <tt>qmake</tt> takes the following simple form: <pre class="snippet">
qmake [mode] [options] files
</pre> <tt>qmake</tt> supports two different modes of operation: In the default mode, <tt>qmake</tt> will use the description in a project file to generate a Makefile, but it is also possible to use <tt>qmake</tt> to generate project files. If you want to explicitly set the mode, you must specify it before all other options. The <tt>mode</tt> can be either of the following two values: <ul><li> <tt>-makefile</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> output will be a Makefile.</li><li> <tt>-project</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> output will be a project file.</li></ul> The following <tt>options</tt> are used to specify both general and mode-specific settings. Options that only apply to the Makefile mode are described in the <a href="qmake-running.html#makefilemode">Makefile Mode Options</a> section; options that influence the creation of project files are described in the <a href="qmake-running.html#projectmode">Project File Options</a> section. <p>The <tt>files</tt> argument represents a list of one or more project files, separated by spaces.<a name="options"><h3>Options</h3> A wide range of options can be specified on the command line to <tt>qmake</tt> in order to customize the build process, and to override default settings for your platform. The following basic options provide usage information, specify where <tt>qmake</tt> writes the output file, and control the level of debugging information that will be written to the console: <ul><li> <tt>-help</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will go over these features and give some useful help.</li><li> <tt>-o</tt> file <br /><tt>qmake</tt> output will be directed to file. If this option is not specified, <tt>qmake</tt> will try to use a suitable file name for its output, depending on the mode it is running in.<br /> If '-' is specified, output is directed to stdout.</li><li> <tt>-d</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will output debugging information.</li></ul> For projects that need to be built differently on each target platform, with many subdirectories, you can run <tt>qmake</tt> with each of the following options to set the corresponding platform-specific variable in each project file: <ul><li> <tt>-unix</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will run in unix mode. In this mode, Unix file naming and path conventions will be used, additionally testing for <tt>unix</tt> (as a scope) will succeed. This is the default mode on all Unices.</li><li> <tt>-macx</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will run in Mac OS X mode. In this mode, Unix file naming and path conventions will be used, additionally testing for <tt>macx</tt> (as a scope) will succeed. This is the default mode on Mac OS X.</li><li> <tt>-win32</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will run in win32 mode. In this mode, Windows file naming and path conventions will be used, additionally testing for <tt>win32</tt> (as a scope) will succeed. This is the default mode on Windows.</li></ul> The template used for the project is usually specified by the <tt>TEMPLATE</tt> variable in the project file. We can override or modify this by using the following options: <ul><li> <tt>-t</tt> tmpl <br /><tt>qmake</tt> will override any set <tt>TEMPLATE</tt> variables with tmpl, but only after the .pro file has been processed.</li><li> <tt>-tp</tt> prefix <br /><tt>qmake</tt> will add the prefix to the <tt>TEMPLATE</tt> variable.</li></ul> The level of warning information can be fine-tuned to help you find problems in your project file: <ul><li> <tt>-Wall</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will report all known warnings.</li><li> <tt>-Wnone</tt><br /> No warning information will be generated by <tt>qmake</tt>.</li><li> <tt>-Wparser</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will only generate parser warnings. This will alert you to common pitfalls and potential problems in the parsing of your project files.</li><li> <tt>-Wlogic</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will warn of common pitfalls and potential problems in your project file. For example, <tt>qmake</tt> will report whether a file is placed into a list of files multiple times, or if a file cannot be found.</li></ul><a name="makefilemode"><a name="makefile-mode-options"><h3>Makefile Mode Options</h3> <pre class="snippet">
qmake -makefile [options] files
</pre> In Makefile mode, <tt>qmake</tt> will generate a Makefile that is used to build the project. Additionally, the following options may be used in this mode to influence the way the project file is generated: <ul><li> <tt>-after</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will process assignments given on the command line after the specified files.</li><li> <tt>-nocache</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will ignore the .qmake.cache file.</li><li> <tt>-nodepend</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will not generate any dependency information.</li><li> <tt>-cache</tt> file <br /><tt>qmake</tt> will use file as the cache file, ignoring any other .qmake.cache files found.</li><li> <tt>-spec</tt> spec <br /><tt>qmake</tt> will use spec as a path to platform and compiler information, and the value of <tt>QMAKESPEC</tt> will be ignored.</li></ul> You may also pass <tt>qmake</tt> assignments on the command line; they will be processed before all of the files specified. For example: <pre class="snippet">
qmake -makefile -unix -o Makefile "CONFIG+=test" test.pro
</pre> This will generate a Makefile, from test.pro with Unix pathnames. However many of the specified options aren't necessary as they are the default. Therefore, the line can be simplified on Unix to: <pre class="snippet">
qmake "CONFIG+=test" test.pro
</pre> If you are certain you want your variables processed after the files specified, then you may pass the <tt>-after</tt> option. When this is specified, all assignments on the command line after the <tt>-after</tt> option will be postponed until after the specified files are parsed.<a name="projectmode"><a name="project-mode-options"><h3>Project Mode Options</h3> <pre class="snippet">
qmake -project [options] files
</pre> In project mode, <tt>qmake</tt> will generate a project file. Additionally, you may supply the following options in this mode: <ul><li> <tt>-r</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will look through supplied directories recursively</li><li> <tt>-nopwd</tt><br /><tt>qmake</tt> will not look in your current working directory for source code and only use the specified <tt>files</tt></li></ul> In this mode, the <tt>files</tt> argument can be a list of files or directories. If a directory is specified, it will be included in the <tt>DEPENDPATH</tt> variable, and relevant code from there will be included in the generated project file. If a file is given, it will be appended to the correct variable, depending on its extension; for example, .ui files are added to <tt>FORMS</tt>, and .cpp files are added to <tt>SOURCES</tt>. <p>You may also pass assignments on the command line in this mode. When doing so, these assignments will be placed last in the generated project file.<p /><address><hr /><div align="center">
