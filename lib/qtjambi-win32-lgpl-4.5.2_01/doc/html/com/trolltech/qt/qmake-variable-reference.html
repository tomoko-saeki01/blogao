Some of these declare resources, such as headers and source files, that are common to each platform; others are used to customize the behavior of compilers and linkers on specific platforms. <p>Platform-specific variables follow the naming pattern of the variables which they extend or modify, but include the name of the relevant platform in their name. For example, <tt>QMAKE_LIBS</tt> can be used to specify a list of libraries that a project needs to link against, and <tt>QMAKE_LIBS_X11</tt> can be used to extend or override this list. <ul></ul><a name="config"><a name="config"><h2>CONFIG</h2> The <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable specifies project configuration and compiler options. The values will be recognized internally by <tt>qmake</tt> and have special meaning. They are as follows. <p>These <tt>CONFIG</tt> values control compilation flags: <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="95%"><thead><tr class="qt-style" valign="top"><th><center> Option</center></th><th><center> Description</center></th></tr></thead><tr valign="top" class="even"><td> release</td><td> The project is to be built in release mode. This is ignored if <tt>debug</tt> is also specified.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td> debug</td><td> The project is to be built in debug mode.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="even"><td> debug_and_release</td><td> The project is built in both debug and release modes. This can have some unexpected side effects (see below for more information).</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td> build_all</td><td> If <tt>debug_and_release</tt> is specified, the project is built in both debug and release modes by default.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="even"><td> ordered</td><td> When using the <tt>subdirs</tt> template, this option specifies that the directories listed should be processed in the order in which they are given.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td> precompile_header</td><td> Enables support for the use of <a href="qmake-precompiledheaders.html">precompiled headers</a> in projects.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="even"><td> warn_on</td><td> The compiler should output as many warnings as possible. This is ignored if <tt>warn_off</tt> is specified.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td> warn_off</td><td> The compiler should output as few warnings as possible.</td></tr></table> Since the <tt>debug</tt> option overrides the <tt>release</tt> option when both are defined in the <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable, it is necessary to use the <tt>debug_and_release</tt> option if you want to allow both debug and release versions of a project to be built. In such a case, the Makefile that <tt>qmake</tt> generates includes a rule that builds both versions, and this can be invoked in the following way: <pre class="snippet">
make all
</pre> On Windows (or if Qt is configured with <tt>-debug_and_release</tt>, adding the <tt>build_all</tt> option to the <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable makes this rule the default when building the project, and installation targets will be created for both debug and release builds. <p>Additionally, adding <tt>debug_and_release</tt> to the <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable will cause both <tt>debug</tt> and <tt>release</tt> to be defined in the contents of <tt>CONFIG</tt>. When the project file is processed, the <a href="qmake-advanced-usage.html#scopes">scopes</a> that test for each value will be processed for both debug and release modes. The <tt>build_pass</tt> variable will be set for each of these mode, and you can test for this to perform build-specific tasks. For example: <pre class="snippet">
build_pass:CONFIG(debug, debug|release) {
    unix: TARGET = $$join(TARGET,,,_debug)
    else: TARGET = $$join(TARGET,,,d)
}
</pre> As a result, it may be useful to define mode-specific variables, such as <a href="qmake-variable-reference.html#qmake-lflags-release">QMAKE_LFLAGS_RELEASE</a>, instead of general variables, such as <a href="qmake-variable-reference.html#qmake-lflags">QMAKE_LFLAGS</a>, where possible. <p>The following options define the application/library type: <table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="95%"><thead><tr class="qt-style" valign="top"><th><center> Option</center></th><th><center> Description</center></th></tr></thead><tr valign="top" class="even"><td> qt</td><td> The target is a Qt application/library and requires the Qt library and header files.

All dependencies, headers and source files required to build these .ui files will automatically be added to the project. <p>For example: <pre class="snippet">
FORMS = mydialog.ui \
    mywidget.ui \
        myconfig.ui
</pre> If FORMS3 is defined in your project, then this variable must contain forms for uic, and not uic3. If CONFIG contains uic3, and FORMS3 is not defined, the this variable must contain only uic3 type forms.<a name="forms3"><a name="forms3"><h2>FORMS3</h2> This variable specifies the old style .ui files to be processed through <tt>uic3</tt> before compiling, when <tt>CONFIG</tt> contains uic3.

     my_uic3_widget.ui \
         my_uic3_config.ui
</pre><a name="guid"><a name="guid"><h2>GUID</h2> Specifies the GUID that is set inside a <tt>.vcproj</tt> file. The GUID is usually randomly determined. However, should you require a fixed GUID, it can be set using this variable. <p>This variable is specific to <tt>.vcproj</tt> files only; it is ignored otherwise.<a name="headers"><a name="headers"><h2>HEADERS</h2> Defines the header files for the project. <p><tt>qmake</tt> will generate dependency information (unless <tt>-nodepend</tt> is specified on the <a href="qmake-running.html#commands">command line</a>) for the specified headers. <tt>qmake</tt> will also automatically detect if <tt>moc</tt> is required by the classes in these headers, and add the appropriate dependencies and files to the project for generating and linking the moc files. <p>For example: <pre class="snippet">
HEADERS = myclass.h \
          login.h \
          mainwindow.h
</pre> See also <a href="qmake-variable-reference.html#sources">SOURCES</a>.<a name="includepath"><a name="includepath"><h2>INCLUDEPATH</h2> This variable specifies the #include directories which should be searched when compiling the project. Use ';' or a space as the directory separator. <p>For example: <pre class="snippet">
INCLUDEPATH = c:/msdev/include d:/stl/include
</pre><a name="installs"><a name="installs"><h2>INSTALLS</h2> This variable contains a list of resources that will be installed when <tt>make install</tt> or a similar installation procedure is executed. Each item in the list is typically defined with attributes that provide information about where it will be installed. <p>For example, the following <tt>target.path</tt> definition describes where the build target will be installed, and the <tt>INSTALLS</tt> assignment adds the build target to the list of existing resources to be installed: <pre class="snippet">
target.path += $$[QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS]/imageformats

All dependencies, headers and source files will automatically be added to the project for building these lex files. <p>For example: <pre class="snippet">
LEXSOURCES = lexer.l
</pre><a name="libs"><a name="libs"><h2>LIBS</h2> This variable contains a list of libraries to be linked into the project. You can use the Unix <tt>-l</tt> (library) and -L (library path) flags and qmake will do the correct thing with these libraries on Windows (namely this means passing the full path of the library to the linker). The only limitation to this is the library must exist, for qmake to find which directory a <tt>-l</tt> lib lives in. <p>For example: <pre class="snippet">
unix:LIBS += -L/usr/local/lib -lmath
win32:LIBS += c:/mylibs/math.lib
</pre> <b>Note:</b> On Windows, specifying libraries with the <tt>-l</tt> option, as in the above example, will cause the library with the highest version number to be used; for example, <tt>libmath2.lib</tt> could potentially be used instead of <tt>libmathlib</tt>. To avoid this ambiguity, we recommend that you explicitly specify the library to be used by including the <tt>.lib</tt> file name suffix. <p>By default, the list of libraries stored in <tt>LIBS</tt> is reduced to a list of unique names before it is used. To change this behavior, add the <tt>no_lflags_merge</tt> option to the <tt>CONFIG</tt> variable: <pre class="snippet">
CONFIG += no_lflags_merge
</pre><a name="literal-hash"><a name="literal-hash"><h2>LITERAL_HASH</h2> This variable is used whenever a literal hash character (<tt>#</tt>) is needed in a variable declaration, perhaps as part of a file name or in a string passed to some external application. <p>For example:Error parsing snippet.</pre> By using <tt>LITERAL_HASH</tt> in this way, the <tt>#</tt> character can be used to construct a URL for the <tt>message()</tt> function to print to the console.<a name="makefile"><a name="makefile"><h2>MAKEFILE</h2> This variable specifies the name of the Makefile which <tt>qmake</tt> should use when outputting the dependency information for building a project. The value of this variable is typically handled by <tt>qmake</tt> or <a href="qmake-variable-reference.html#qmakespec">qmake.conf</a> and rarely needs to be modified.<a name="makefile-generator"><a name="makefile-generator"><h2>MAKEFILE_GENERATOR</h2> This variable contains the name of the Makefile generator to use when generating a Makefile. The value of this variable is typically handled internally by <tt>qmake</tt> and rarely needs to be modified.<a name="moc-dir"><a name="moc-dir"><h2>MOC_DIR</h2> This variable specifies the directory where all intermediate moc files should be placed. <p>For example: <pre class="snippet">
unix:MOC_DIR = ../myproject/tmp
win32:MOC_DIR = c:/myproject/tmp
</pre><a name="objects"><a name="objects"><h2>OBJECTS</h2> This variable is generated from the <a href="qmake-variable-reference.html#sources">SOURCES</a> variable. The extension of each source file will have been replaced by .o (Unix) or .obj (Win32).
