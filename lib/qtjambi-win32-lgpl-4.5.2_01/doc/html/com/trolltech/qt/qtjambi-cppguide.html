We will give a quick guide to issues that might confuse or misslead unexpecting C++ programmers venturing into the Java World with Qt Jambi. <p>We present these issues in a list in the next section.<a name="the-list"><h2>The List</h2> We here present a list of issues that it might be good to know about. <ul><li> <b>Collecting garbage</b>: Garbage Collection of Jambi objects are handled automatically, so you do not have to worry about object ownership. They will all be deleted automatically.</li><li> <b>Where did <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/QVariant.html">QVariant</a> go?</b>: <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/QVariant.html">QVariant</a> is Qt's way to deal with that C++ forbids unions from including types that have non-default constructors or destructors. In Java, <b>all</b> classes inherits from the same ancestor, <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>; they are all already united, so there is no need for a <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/QVariant.html">QVariant</a> anymore. In the places you find <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/QVariant.html">QVariant</a>s in the C++ API, you will find <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>s in the Java API. <p>Jambi has its own <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/QVariant.html">QVariant</a>, but that only serves as a set of methods to do datatype conversions.</li><li> <b>Enums and Values</b>: In Java enums are first-class citizens, so ...</li><li> <b>"Where is QVector?" or "What about collection classes?"</b>: Qt Jambi converts between Java and Qt collection classes. You will find the Java versions in the <tt>java.util</tt> package. The Qt collection classes are not ported to Java.</li><li> <b>Value and Object types</b>: In Java we have no value and object types. All objects behave like C++ object types, and they are all sent by reference. Notice that Qt Jambi does copy objects sent as value types (typically by const reference) and returned from methods.</li><li> <b>What about Signals and Slots?</b>: Qt Jambi has implemented its own mechanism for signals and slots. It works basically in the same way, but the syntax is somewhat different. See the {Signals and Slots} overview.</li><li> <b>Flagging with QFlags</b>: Java's enum values cannot directly be used as ints and OR'ed together when constructing QFlags, which makes constructing flags a lot more verbose in Java. Study the QFlags and QtEnumerator class descriptions and you will see the light.</li><li> <b></b> :</li></ul> Note that using the '=' operator in java is a potentially dangerous operation for C++ programmers used to value types. In C++, the object will be copied and a new reference returned, but in Java, you will just get a new reference to the same object. If you wan't to copy an object, you will have to copy it field by field, or use any copy constructor explicitly. <p>Note also that Java has run-time type inference. We can therefore leave the Qt <tt>rcc</tt> tool and all the <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html">QObject</a> macros. Also the Qt Meta Object System, with its properties and is unessasary in Java, because of the introspection provided for all classes provided by Java (see the <tt>java.lang.reflect</tt> package for details). <p>That sums up the most important issues to be aware about. If you bump into others you feel deserve a place in this list, don't hesitate to let us know through the Jambi mailing list.<p /><address><hr /><div align="center">
