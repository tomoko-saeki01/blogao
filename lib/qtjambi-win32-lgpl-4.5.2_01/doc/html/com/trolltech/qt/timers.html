With <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html#startTimer(int)">QObject::startTimer()</a>, you start a timer with an interval in milliseconds as argument. The function returns a unique integer timer ID. The timer will now fire at regular intervals until you explicitly call <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html#killTimer(int)">QObject::killTimer()</a> with the timer ID. <p>For this mechanism to work, the application must run in an event loop. You start an event loop with <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/gui/QApplication.html#exec()">QApplication::exec()</a>. When a timer fires, the application sends a <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimerEvent.html">QTimerEvent</a>, and the flow of control leaves the event loop until the timer event is processed. This implies that a timer cannot fire while your application is busy doing something else. In other words: the accuracy of timers depends on the granularity of your application. <p>In multithreaded applications, you can use the timer mechanism in any thread that has an event loop. To start an event loop from a non-GUI thread, use QThread::exec(). Qt uses the the object's <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html#thread()">thread affinity</a> to determine which thread will deliver the <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimerEvent.html">QTimerEvent</a>. Because of this, you must start and stop all timers in the object's thread; it is not possible to start timers for objects in another thread. <p>The upper limit for the interval value is determined by the number of milliseconds that can be specified in a signed integer (in practice, this is a period of just over 24 days). The accuracy depends on the underlying operating system. Windows 98 has 55 millisecond accuracy; other systems that we have tested can handle 1 millisecond intervals. <p>The main API for the timer functionality is <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimer.html">QTimer</a>. That class provides regular timers that emit a signal when the timer fires, and inherits <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html">QObject</a> so that it fits well into the ownership structure of most GUI programs. The normal way of using it is like this: <pre class="snippet">
        QTimer timer = new QTimer(this);
    
        timer.timeout.connect(this, "updateCaption()");
    
        timer.start(1000);
    </pre> The <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimer.html">QTimer</a> object is made into a child of this widget so that, when this widget is deleted, the timer is deleted too. Next, its timeout() signal is connected to the slot that will do the work, it is started with a value of 1000 milliseconds, indicating that it will time out every second. <p><a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimer.html">QTimer</a> also provides a static function for single-shot timers. For example: <pre class="snippet">
        QTimer.singleShot(200, this, "updateCaption()");
    </pre> 200 milliseconds (0.2 seconds) after this line of code is executed, the <tt>updateCaption()</tt> slot will be called. <p>For <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimer.html">QTimer</a> to work, you must have an event loop in your application; that is, you must call <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QCoreApplication.html#exec()">QCoreApplication::exec()</a> somewhere. Timer events will be delivered only while the event loop is running. <p>In multithreaded applications, you can use <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimer.html">QTimer</a> in any thread that has an event loop. To start an event loop from a non-GUI thread, use QThread::exec(). Qt uses the the timer's <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html#thread()">thread affinity</a> to determine which thread will emit the timeout() signal. Because of this, you must start and stop the timer in its thread; it is not possible to start a timer from another thread. <p>The <a href="qtjambi-analogclock.html">Analog Clock</a> example shows how to use <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimer.html">QTimer</a> to redraw a widget at regular intervals. From <tt>AnalogClock</tt>'s implementation:<br><br>The following code example is written in c++.<br> <pre class="snippet"> 
AnalogClock::AnalogClock(QWidget *parent)

    : QWidget(parent)

{

    QTimer *timer = new QTimer(this);

    connect(timer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(update()));

    timer-&gt;start(1000);
...
}
 </pre> Every second, <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimer.html">QTimer</a> will call the <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/gui/QWidget.html#update()">QWidget::update()</a> slot to refresh the clock's display. <p>If you already have a <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html">QObject</a> subclass and want an easy optimization, you can use <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QBasicTimer.html">QBasicTimer</a> instead of <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QTimer.html">QTimer</a>. With <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QBasicTimer.html">QBasicTimer</a>, you must reimplement <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html#timerEvent(com.trolltech.qt.core.QTimerEvent)">timerEvent()</a> in your <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QObject.html">QObject</a> subclass and handle the timeout there. The <a href="qtjambi-wiggly.html">Wiggly</a> example shows how to use <a href="../../../com/trolltech/qt/core/QBasicTimer.html">QBasicTimer</a>.<p /><address><hr /><div align="center">
